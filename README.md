DartmouthCampusGuide
====================

Implemented an app on Android by JAVA and XML which can post sites in Dartmouth online with either picture and audio. Also implemented a website server by JSP, jQuery to check and manage the sites others post. You can get the app on http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~tyun/cs65/CampusWiki.apk and see the website on http://dartcampuswiki.appspot.com

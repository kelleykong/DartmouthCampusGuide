DartmouthCampusGuide
====================

State first: the code cannot be referred. The project is not for profit just now. Please do not take any idea, pic, code.

It is a project in my first-year graduate student in Dartmouth College.


Implemented an app on Android by JAVA and XML which can post sites in Dartmouth online with either picture and audio. Also implemented a website server by JSP, jQuery to check and manage the sites others post. You can get the app on http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~tyun/cs65/CampusWiki.apk and see the website on http://dartcampuswiki.appspot.com
